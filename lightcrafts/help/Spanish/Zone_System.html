    <h1>The Zone System</h1>
    <p>
      
      The <b>Zone System</b> was developed by Ansel Adams and Fred Archer
      in the 1940s as a method for achieving consistent results
      from exposing negative film all the way to paper prints.

      The Zone System is a framework
      that photographers can use to think about their photos
      and perform meaningful operations on them,
      such as altering exposure, contrast,
      and most all other visual aspects of a photo.
    
    </p>
    <p>
      
      With the <a href="ZoneFinder.html">ZoneFinder</a> and
      <a href="Tool-ZoneMapper.html">ZoneMapper</a> tool,
      LightZone offers a unique implementation of the Zone System
      that has been adapted from negative film to digital media
      and interactive image processing allowed by modern computers.

      If you are familiar with the Zone System,
      you probably have noticed that there are differences
      between the traditional Zone System and LightZone.

              The traditional Zone System was developed for negative film
              and has 11 zones where each zone
              differs by one <em>exposure value</em>
              (one "EV" which is equivalent to one f-stop).
              Middle (or 18%) gray falls onto zone 5.
            
            </p>
            <p>
              
              The traditional Zone System takes into account
              the nonlinear nature of both film and photographic paper
              that compresses the tonal values of highlights and shadows
              (the "shoulder" and "toe"
              of photographic media).

              LightZone instead was developed for digital cameras and computers
              and has 16 zones where each zone
              differs by <i>half</i> an EV.
              Middle gray falls onto the fifth zone from the top.
            
            </p>
            <p>
              
              The reason for the differences
              are that digital cameras and computers
              use a linear representation for values of light
              and that computer displays have a dynamic range
              that is less than 8 EVs.
              Using half EV spacing for zones in LightZone results in 16 zones
              and gives the best compromise between screen space and precision.
