CantRunSSE2Title=Can't Launch LightZone
CantRunSSE2=LightZone on Linux requires a CPU supporting the SSE2 instruction set.  This requirement was introduced with version 2.4, in May 2007.
FoundProcCpuinfo=LightZone has examined /proc/cpuinfo on this computer and found "$1", with no SSE2 flag set.  LightZone must now quit.
